# Class 1 Homework

## Practice using classes

Make a new class called ```Instrument```

The make other classes. You could make, for example:
- Wood
- String
- Brass

Make the above classes extend instrument, and make properties and methods for
all your classes, putting common methods in the Instrument class

## Practice using Ajax

To be able to do ajax requests to jsonplaceholder, you need to have your html
page served from a server. You can do this by:

```
npm install -g http-server
```

then after that is done, from wherever you have your html file (i.e if you do
ls, you should see your file), run

```
http-server
```

Here is me doing it from the class repo:

```

$ cd 2018-spring-web-apps/
$ ls
README.md class-01
$ cd class-01/
$ ls
HOMEWORK.md       README.md         in-class.html     pre-in-class.html
$ http-server
Starting up http-server, serving ./
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
  http://192.168.0.112:8080
  http://172.23.1.22:8080
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server

```

You can then open localhost:8080 from your web browser

Using the fetch api, make a ```POST``` request to this [website](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), you may find this [page](https://github.com/typicode/jsonplaceholder#how-to) useful.
