# Class 2 Homework

## Practice using pure and class based components

Build a very basic blog site. Have a basic form that takes the title of the blog
post, the body of the post, and the author. When the user hits submit, take that
information and show it on the page. At first you can just show the latest post
that was created, but another approach could be to show each blog post you
create in some kind of list format, similar to a scrolling news feed. 

When building things like this, consider what you should do when the user hits
submit, and whether you should allow empty inputs, for example, what should you
do if the title is provided, but no author, or body?
